## The CraggsCube

Single molecule FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) can be used to obtain a unque level of infomation specifically for dynamic processes involving biological molcules. The Craggs group of The University of Sheffield has developed an open-source microscopsy platform for making smFRET measurements at a fraction of the price of typical commerical systems. The CraggsCube system can be built for around 50,000 GBP using commerically availible parts and fabrification of a simple microscoe body. 

This webpage presents a modular platform based on a confocal system offering high stabilty, flexibility and a compact design.
